# The NURBS Code

This Project is still under development. 

- This tool kits are developed for utilizing 2D NURBS curves with double precision, and mainly involves the following functions:
  - create 2D NURBS curve;
  - Evaluate the point ...
- This  mainly refers to the algorithm in the book and refers to [tinyburns](https://github.com/pradeep-pyro/tinynurbs).
